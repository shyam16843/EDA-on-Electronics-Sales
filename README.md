\## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

\- What are the monthly/quarterly sales trends?

\- Which product categories perform best/worst?

\- How do customer demographics (age, gender) affect sales?

\- What is the impact of payment methods on order completion?



\## 📊 Methodology

1\. \*\*Data Loading \& Inspection\*\*

2\. \*\*Data Cleaning\*\* (missing values, transformations)

3\. \*\*Descriptive Statistics\*\* (mean, median, distribution)

4\. \*\*Univariate \& Bivariate Analysis\*\*

5\. \*\*Visualization\*\* (ggplot2, heatmaps)

6\. \*\*Insight Generation\*\*
